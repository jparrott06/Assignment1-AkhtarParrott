<!-- 

Requirements:

//General//

'Your pages should have

A Header (including title and logo)
Design a nice header using images, texts, etc.
Get creative and design your own logo, or use someone else’s logo (as long as it’s not another class student)
A footer
Get Creative, add a section for useful links, copyright data, etc.
A Navigation menu (either on the side or on the header)
It doesn’t have to be collapsible but needs to look decent.'

//Home//

1) Build a home page for users (their main social network page).

- The homepage must look professional and include all different components of the social network that you have in mind,
  and include links to other pages you’ll add in the future.

- Who to follow, trending hashtags, link to messages, link to profile

2) The page must be populated with static dummy data for the sake of presentation

- For example, a few posts by different users, etc.
  You can choose to make your social network look similar to Facebook or Twitter Web apps (not Mobile apps) 
  and build a similar homepage to those.

  Instead, you can think of a different type of social network and design that.
